 * doing that on every streamed chunk would make the whole dashboard chrome
 * repaint dozens of times a second.
 *
 * The conversation is in memory only. It survives navigation between views,
 * which is the point of the dock, but not a reload. Server-side persistence is a
 * separate feature with its own storage and retention questions.
 *
 * While the "warp" feature flag is off, or the caller lacks WarpSession View or
 * Warp View, the provider publishes null, which every consumer already treats
 * as "no Warp here": the launcher, the ⌘I shortcut and the dock all stand down.
 * The provider itself stays mounted either way - swapping it for a bare
 * fragment would change the element type above the whole dashboard and remount
 * every page when the flag query resolves.
