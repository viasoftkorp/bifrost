// FailureClass says what a failed attempt tells Bifrost about the key and the route it
// used, which is what the retry loop needs to decide whether to retry the same key, move
// to another key, or stop. It is stamped on every KeyAttemptRecord that reached the
// provider.
//
// It is deliberately separate from ErrorType. That vocabulary attributes fault for the
// error_type metric label and is derived from the status code alone; this one drives
// retry and exclusion policy and is derived from the provider's own error code, type or
// exception name wherever the provider exposes one. A status alone decides only what it
// has always decided for the retry loop (401, 402, 403, 429 and the transient 5xx set);
// every other class needs a parsed signal, since providers disagree on which status
// carries which fact.
