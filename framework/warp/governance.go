// key read every config store already has - the enterprise wrapper applies
// the caller's key scope inside it, so a name lookup cannot reach a key the
// caller may not see. Optional: a reader without it answers by id only.
//
// It exists because describe_filter_space lists keys from logged traffic, and
// a key that was just created, or has not been used in a month, is not there.
// Asked for that key's budget, Warp concluded the key did not exist - a false
// statement about a key sitting in the dashboard. A name lookup that reads
// configuration rather than traffic is what makes "the key X" answerable
// whether or not X has ever been used.

// governance, before describe_virtual_key projects it.
//
// A key row is not the whole story of what caps a key. A standalone key keeps
// its budgets and rate limit in key-scoped model configs the dashboard
// rehydrates before serialising, and on an enterprise deployment a key that an
// access profile hands a user is minted bare on purpose - its budgets, rate
// limit and providers live on the owner's profile, and the key's own rows are
// stripped when it joins one. Read raw, such a key reports "no budget" while
// the dashboard shows $450 with 85% used. The decorator is the same set of
// overlays the dashboard's key read paths apply, handed to Warp by the HTTP
// layer that owns them; the package itself never imports them.
//
// It mutates vk in place (Budgets, RateLimit, IsAccessProfileManaged,
// AssignedUser) and returns the names of whatever governs the key from outside
// - "access profile admin" - or nothing when the key governs itself. An error
// means the governance could not be resolved, and the tool reports that
